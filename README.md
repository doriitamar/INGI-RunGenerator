# INGInious/RunGenerator

This module is a [run file](https://inginious.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4/teacher_doc/run_file.html) generator for [INGInious](https://github.com/UCL-INGI/INGInious).
The original purpose was to enable anonymous code execution with integrating LMS, the execution is meant to be **agnostic** of the expected result, and thus, the generated script is returning a JSON contaning only dry details about the execution itself.

This module is stiil in it's infancy so feel free to open issues with feature requests!

# Install

```bash
$ npm install run-gen
```

After installing with `npm` you can require this library from JavaScript or TypeScript:

JavaScript
```js
const RunGen = require('run-gen');
```

TypeScript:
```typescript
import RunGen from "run-gen";
```

# Usage

## Library

```js
run-gen.generateRun(language: ("cpp"|"java"|"python"), cases: [{input: [String], inputFiles:[File] ,outputFiles:[File]}...], problemId: String): string
```
Generates a run file for a task that has one sub-problem and runs all of the `cases`.
The script itself returns a JSON - an array of case results.


Example

```js
> RunGen.generateRun("cpp", [{"input": ["a"],"inputFiles": [{"name": "ingi", "content": "is good"}], "outputFiles": []}], "thecode");
```
#### Output
```bash
\#!/bin/bash


# Parsing input for thecode
getinput "thecode" > student_code.cpp


# Compiling using cpp compiler
g++ -o student_code.out student_code.cpp &> compiler


touch input
feedback-msg -aem "["


# Case #0:
echo "a" > input

./student_code.out < input > output 2>error

output=$(<output)

compiler=$(<compiler)


#Escape characters

echo $output | sed -e "s/[\]/\\\\\\\/g" > output

output=$(<output)

errors=$(<error)

feedback-msg -aem "{\"status\": \"ok\",\"compiler\":\"$compiler\",\"error\": \"$errors\", \"output\": \"$output\", \"files\":[]}"

feedback-msg -aem "]"


# Failing every automatic-generated test, since CodeIT handles validations

feedback-result failed
```
